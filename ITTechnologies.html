							<p>A cloud server is a virtual server running a cloud computing environment, it has been built and is hosted via the internet and can be accessed remotely.  Cloud services are used for storing, processing, and exchanging information within a set group of people on demand.</p>
							<p>A cloud service is normally provided via these different means:</p>
							<ul>
									<li>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides the infrastructure many cloud service providers need to manage software tools. It serves as the complete data centre framework.</li>
									<li>Platform as a service (PaaS) serves as a web-based environment where developers can build cloud apps. PaaS provides a database, operating system and programming language organizations can use to develop cloud-based software.</li>
									<li>Software as a service (SaaS) This broad category encompasses a variety of services, such as file storage and backup, web-based email and project management tools.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Many users are accessing the cloud storage section of this service.  Daily increased amounts of users are accessing Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox and many more providers of storage.  These storage services can take digital files such as photos and documents and store them for easy accesses from any device.</p>
							<p>Here are a few more examples of what can be done with cloud services now:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Create, test and build applications;</li>
								<li>Store, backup and recovery of data;</li>
								<li>Stream audio and video;</li>
								<li>Deliver software on demand;</li>
								<li>Analyse data by using machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>As the availability of cloud services continues to expand, so will the future of this service grow.  A combination of using a cloud service and cloud-based software products and on-premises will help create hybrid IT solutions.  These features which can be done now, will be bigger and faster as cloud services grow.  Increased storage for data will become more reliable and cheaper as cloud users grow.  The performance of using the internet will become faster as the ability to receive and deliver data via the web will be quicker using close based applications.  </p>
							<p>The main technology supporting cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks.</p>
							<p>The likely impact of the development of Cloud servers and services is positive. Users and Businesses will have more reliable 27/7 access to their data, and this can allow for improved collaboration and financial benefits to businesses due to higher productivity, communications and flexibility for staff.</p>
							<p>As Cybersecurity improves so will the security of cloud-based products.  One of the most important factors when choosing a cloud service is the security and privacy provided to data. Therefore, cloud providers invest large amounts on their services and infrastructure to offer better security. It is the responsibility of the cloud service to ensure they provide data security and privacy. As cloud services are accessed through the internet, there is risk of attack by the hackers to steal data and cause damage. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully choose a cloud provider and verify the methods and tools being used by the cloud to ensure the security and privacy to data.</p>
							<p> [6] According to the statist’s portal, the total number of cloud-based users are approaching 3.4 billion, which is about half of the total population of the world in 2018. This data clearly shows the cloud services are expanding exponentially and will soon dominate the information technology market. Because of the growth of this technology, any businesses and industries looking to migrate to the cloud, it would be advisable to hire a team of skilled cybersecurity and cloud computing specialists, and data analysts professionals who know how to use this technology efficiently and be keen on keeping their skills upgraded.</p>
							<p>As a cloud user I believe the impact of any changes to cloud services will be of great benefit to myself.  Currently I use a combination Apple and Google cloud services for my personal data and files along with social networks.  I access these cloud applications via iPad, iPhone, MacBook or Dell Laptop.</p>
							<p>My workplace uses Microsoft cloud service, which I had not used much of until Covid-19. Once Covid-19 lockdowns began, I started to use the MS Cloud service of OneDrive/SharePoint. I found them to both be durable, accessible and reliable when working from home.  Had I not transferred important documents I required to use from the work drive to the cloud before leaving the workplace, I may not have found working from home as successful. I now rely highly on the cloud to store and share these documents, as access to the main server had not been set up for VPN access at the time. My team has now migrated our directory and server files to the SharePoint cloud for improved collaboration and file sharing.  Before Covid-19 files were shared via attachment to emails.</p>
							<p>I would like to see the effects of cloud services improve for my family and friends. In the way they access healthcare systems, educational institutions, government, and financial aspects.  Having been the person who typically sets up the cloud services for family and friends I found it has better connected our ability to communicate and share photos of memories.</p>
							<p>If the cloud could be used to improve patient data access between hospitals and medical clinics, this would assist in the diagnosis of illnesses where medical staff have the same information shared with the GP and visa versa.</p>
							<p>A large volume of education is still not accessible via the internet meaning students are still required to attend a campus and thus causing an impact on roads and public transport. If students were able to access these courses from home there could be an improvement to a student’s education and a chance to add a few hours a week not traveling to university, but travelling to a part time job in their interest of study and earning more money with extra hours working around their own personal timetable.</p>
